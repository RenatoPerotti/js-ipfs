# Mutable File System examples

The MFS is a file system abstraction built on top of IPFS.  It supports all the operations you would expect such as creating directories, adding files to them, renaming, coping, deleting, etc.

## Running the demo

In this directory:

```
$ npm install     (don't be bothered by the WARNings)
$ npm start       (do this twice the first time)
```

Then open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser.
